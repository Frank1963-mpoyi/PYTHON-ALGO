EXERCISE

Hello Frank

Exercise 3:
----------
write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to 
computer gross pay.

we won't worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal
place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function
to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.
